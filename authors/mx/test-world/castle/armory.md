# Castle Armory

The castle armory houses an impressive collection of weapons and armor, meticulously maintained by the royal smiths. Racks of gleaming swords line the stone walls, while suits of plate armor stand at attention like silent sentinels. The air carries the scent of oil and metal polish, and the sound of hammering echoes from the adjacent forge. A heavy oak table dominates the center of the room, scattered with maintenance tools and weapon requisitions.
