# Royal Gardens

An oasis of beauty within the castle walls, the royal gardens showcase carefully tended flower beds, manicured hedges, and fruit trees in perfect rows. Gravel paths wind between rose bushes and herb gardens, leading to a central fountain where crystal-clear water dances in the sunlight. Stone benches provide peaceful resting spots among the greenery, while trellises heavy with climbing vines create natural archways. The air is sweet with the perfume of blooming flowers and the gentle hum of working bees.
