# Castle Greenhouse

A marvel of engineering, the greenhouse extends the growing season year-round with its glass walls and carefully controlled environment. Exotic plants from distant lands thrive in the humid warmth, their unusual blooms and strange fragrances creating an almost otherworldly atmosphere. Misting systems keep the air perfectly humid, while coal braziers provide gentle heat during cold months. The royal botanist tends to rare specimens that would be impossible to grow in the harsh outdoor climate.
