# Library Upper Gallery

The upper gallery of the royal library houses the kingdom's most precious manuscripts and forbidden texts. Glass cases protect illuminated scrolls from the elements, while iron-bound chests contain documents too dangerous for common access. A narrow walkway circles the perimeter, offering views down to the main library floor. The air here is thinner and carries an almost mystical quality, as if the accumulated wisdom of ages has given the space itself a form of consciousness.
