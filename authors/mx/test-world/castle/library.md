# Royal Library

Towering shelves of ancient tomes reach toward the vaulted ceiling, filled with centuries of accumulated knowledge. Dust motes dance in shafts of golden sunlight streaming through tall windows. The smell of old parchment and leather bindings permeates the air. Ornate reading desks are scattered throughout, each equipped with brass lamps and magnifying glasses for detailed study. A spiral staircase leads to an upper gallery where the rarest manuscripts are kept under lock and key.
