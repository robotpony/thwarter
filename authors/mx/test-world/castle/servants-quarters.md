# Servants' Quarters

A long, narrow hall lined with simple wooden doors leading to modest sleeping chambers. The quarters house the castle's numerous staff members in basic but comfortable accommodations. Rough-hewn beds with straw mattresses occupy most of each small room, while personal belongings are stored in simple wooden chests. Oil lamps provide flickering light, and the sound of muffled conversations and occasional laughter echoes through the thin walls as servants rest between their duties.
