# Castle Stables

The stables house the castle's prized warhorses and working animals in spacious wooden stalls. Fresh hay fills the feeding troughs, while the scent of horses and leather tack permeates the air. Saddles, bridles, and other riding equipment hang from pegs along the walls, meticulously maintained by the stable hands. The sound of horses nickering and stamping echoes through the building, while shafts of sunlight stream through gaps in the wooden walls, illuminating dust motes floating in the warm air.
