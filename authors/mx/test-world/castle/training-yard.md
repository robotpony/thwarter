# Training Yard

An open courtyard dedicated to military training, surrounded by high stone walls. The packed earth is marked with scuff marks and weapon strikes from countless training sessions. Practice dummies stuffed with straw stand at one end, pierced by arrows and scarred by sword strikes. Weapon racks hold an assortment of training weapons - blunted swords, practice spears, and padded clubs. The clash of metal on metal rings out as guards hone their skills under the watchful eye of their instructors.
