# Royal Treasury

Behind heavy iron doors lies the royal treasury. Chests overflow with gold coins and precious gems, while shelves line the walls holding artifacts from across the realm. The air shimmers with the wealth of generations, but also carries an aura of careful protection - this is no ordinary storage room.
