# Deep Woods

The forest grows darker and more mysterious as you venture deeper into its heart. Massive tree trunks tower overhead like ancient pillars supporting a living cathedral. The undergrowth is thick with ferns and brambles, making passage difficult. Strange sounds echo from the shadows - the hoot of an owl, the rustle of unseen creatures, and the occasional crack of a branch. Shafts of filtered sunlight create pools of green light in the perpetual twilight of the deep forest.
