# Forest Hollow

A natural depression in the forest floor creates a sheltered hollow where fallen trees have created a cozy enclosed space. The hollow is carpeted with soft moss and fallen leaves, making it an ideal resting spot for weary travelers. Ancient logs serve as natural benches, while overhead the canopy provides protection from rain and wind. The air is still and peaceful here, broken only by the distant sound of the stream and the occasional rustle of small woodland creatures.
