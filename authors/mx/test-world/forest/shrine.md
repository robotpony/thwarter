# Ancient Shrine

An ancient stone shrine stands in a small clearing, covered in moss and carved with symbols from a forgotten civilization. The shrine appears to be dedicated to some forest deity, with offerings of flowers, berries, and polished stones left by unknown visitors. Vines have grown around the structure, partially reclaiming it for the forest. Despite its age, the shrine radiates a sense of active spiritual presence, and the air shimmers slightly around its weathered stones.
