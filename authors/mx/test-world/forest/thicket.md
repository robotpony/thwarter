# Dense Thicket

A nearly impenetrable wall of thorny bushes and tangled vines blocks easy passage through this part of the forest. The undergrowth is so thick that visibility is limited to just a few feet in any direction. Thorns catch at clothing and skin, while the air is heavy with the scent of rotting leaves and hidden flowers. Despite the difficulty of movement, the thicket teems with life - birds nest in the protective brambles, and small animals create hidden pathways through the maze of vegetation.
