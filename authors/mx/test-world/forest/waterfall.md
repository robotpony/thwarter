# Hidden Waterfall

The forest stream cascades down a series of rocky ledges, creating a beautiful waterfall that thunders into a deep pool below. Mist rises from the churning water, creating rainbows in the dappled sunlight that filters through the canopy. The sound is deafening up close, drowning out all other forest noises. Behind the falling water, a small cave entrance is barely visible through the spray. The pool at the base is deep and crystal clear, fed by the constant flow from above.
