# Gareth the Blacksmith

Gareth is a mountain of a man whose powerful arms can shape the hardest steel with ease. His forge burns day and night, and the rhythm of his hammer has become a comforting sound throughout the castle. Despite his intimidating size, he has a gentle soul and takes particular pride in crafting tools that make other people's work easier. His apprentices both fear and adore him.
