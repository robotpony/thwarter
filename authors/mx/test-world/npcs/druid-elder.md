# Thornwick the Druid Elder

Thornwick is an ancient guardian of the forest whose age is impossible to determine. His beard is woven with moss and small flowers, and his robes seem to be made from living vines that continue to grow. He speaks with the voice of rustling leaves and moving earth, and his presence brings peace to all woodland creatures. His wisdom spans centuries, and he remembers when the castle was first built in this ancient forest.
