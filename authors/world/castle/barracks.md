# Guard Barracks

The barracks house the castle's military garrison in utilitarian but comfortable quarters. Rows of sturdy bunk beds line the walls, each with a footlocker for personal effects. Weapons and armor hang from wall pegs, ready for immediate use in case of emergency. A central table serves for meals, gaming, and tactical discussions. The atmosphere carries the disciplined camaraderie of professional soldiers, with the occasional sound of dice games or shared war stories echoing through the space.
