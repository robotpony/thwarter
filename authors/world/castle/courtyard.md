# Castle Courtyard

You stand in the grand courtyard of an ancient castle. Tall stone walls rise around you, covered in ivy and weathered by countless storms. A magnificent fountain sits in the center, though it has long since run dry. To the north, the main keep towers above, while passages lead east to the gardens and west to the stables.
