# Castle Forge

The forge burns with constant intensity, casting dancing shadows across the soot-stained walls. Master smiths work tirelessly at massive anvils, their hammers ringing out in rhythmic percussion as they shape red-hot metal. Bellows wheeze and roar, feeding air to the blazing furnaces that can melt even the hardest steel. The heat is overwhelming, and sweat drips continuously from the workers' brows as they craft weapons and tools for the castle's needs.
