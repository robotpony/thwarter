# Great Hall

The great hall stretches before you, its vaulted ceiling disappearing into shadows above. Long wooden tables fill the space, though they now sit empty and dust-covered. Ancient tapestries hang on the walls, depicting scenes of long-forgotten battles. At the far end, a throne sits upon a raised dais.
