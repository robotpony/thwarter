# Castle Kitchen

The heart of the castle's daily life, the kitchen bustles with constant activity. Massive stone hearths line one wall, their fires crackling beneath iron cauldrons and roasting spits. Long wooden tables are scarred from years of chopping and preparation, while copper pots hang from overhead racks like metallic fruit. The aroma of bread, roasted meat, and herbs fills the warm air. Scullery maids hurry between the pantry and cooking areas, their arms laden with ingredients for the next feast.
