# Castle Pantry

The pantry serves as the castle's primary food storage, with shelves stretching from floor to ceiling packed with preserved goods. Barrels of salted meat and pickled vegetables occupy the floor space, while sacks of grain lean against the walls. Hanging herbs and dried fruits dangle from the rafters, filling the cool air with their concentrated aromas. A small window provides just enough light to navigate the narrow passages between the stored provisions.
