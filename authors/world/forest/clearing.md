# Forest Clearing

A peaceful circular clearing opens up among the dense trees, where wildflowers carpet the ground in brilliant colors. Butterflies dance among the blooms while bees hum contentedly as they gather nectar. A ring of ancient standing stones marks the perimeter, weathered by centuries but still imposing. The clearing feels sacred, as if it has been a gathering place for forest dwellers since time immemorial. Sunlight streams down unobstructed, creating a warm sanctuary within the cool forest.
