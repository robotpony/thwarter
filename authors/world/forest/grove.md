# Sacred Grove

This grove feels different from the rest of the forest - older, more alive, touched by magic. The trees here are massive and perfectly arranged in a natural circle, their branches intertwining overhead to form a living dome. Soft, silvery light filters through the leaves even at night, and the air hums with an almost tangible energy. Ancient carvings spiral up the bark of the largest trees, depicting symbols whose meaning has been lost to time. A sense of peace and reverence permeates the space.
