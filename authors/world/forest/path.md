# Forest Path

A winding dirt path leads through the ancient forest surrounding the castle. Tall oak and pine trees create a natural canopy overhead, filtering the sunlight into dappled patterns on the forest floor. The air is fresh with the scent of moss and fallen leaves. To the north, you can see the castle walls through the trees.
