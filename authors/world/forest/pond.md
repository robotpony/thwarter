# Forest Pond

A tranquil pond reflects the sky like a natural mirror, its surface occasionally disturbed by rising fish or visiting woodland creatures. Cattails and reeds line the muddy shores, providing shelter for frogs whose evening chorus fills the air with music. Dragonflies skim across the water's surface, their iridescent wings catching the light. A weathered wooden dock extends into the water, perfect for quiet contemplation or fishing in the early morning hours.
