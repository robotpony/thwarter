# Forest Ravine

A steep-sided ravine cuts through the forest like a wound in the earth, its walls lined with exposed roots and rocky outcroppings. A narrow path winds down into the depths, treacherous but passable for the sure-footed. The air grows cooler as you descend, carrying the scent of damp earth and hidden springs. Strange echoes bounce off the ravine walls, and patches of unusual fungi glow with a faint phosphorescence in the darker recesses.
