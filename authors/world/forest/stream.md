# Forest Stream

A crystal-clear stream winds through the forest, its gentle babbling creating a soothing melody that mingles with birdsong. Smooth river stones line the streambed, visible through the transparent water where small fish dart between the shadows. Willow trees droop their branches into the current, while water lilies float in the calmer pools. The banks are soft with moss and dotted with colorful pebbles washed smooth by countless seasons of flowing water.
