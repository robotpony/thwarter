# Wolf Den

A rocky outcropping provides the entrance to a wolf den, though it appears to have been abandoned for some time. Scratch marks on nearby trees and scattered bones suggest this was once the territory of a large pack. The entrance is partially hidden by overgrown bushes, and the air carries the faint musk of wild animals. Though empty now, the den still feels dangerous, as if the wolves might return at any moment. The forest is eerily quiet in this area, as other animals avoid the territory.
