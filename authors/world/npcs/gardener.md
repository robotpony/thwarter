# Old Willem the Gardener

Old Willem has tended the castle gardens for over forty years, and his weathered hands know every plant by touch. He moves slowly but purposefully among his beloved flowers and herbs, speaking to them in gentle whispers. His garden is his masterpiece, a living artwork that changes with the seasons. Though he rarely speaks, when he does offer advice, people listen carefully.
