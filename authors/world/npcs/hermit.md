# Cedric the Forest Hermit

Cedric chose to leave civilization behind many years ago, finding peace in the solitude of the deep woods. He lives simply but contentedly, gathering what he needs from the forest and bothering no one. His knowledge of wilderness survival is unmatched, and he occasionally helps lost travelers find their way. Though he appears rough and wild, his eyes hold a gentle wisdom born of years in nature's embrace.
