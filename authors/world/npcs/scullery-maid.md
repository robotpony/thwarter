# Emma the Scullery Maid

Emma is a young woman who works tirelessly in the castle kitchen, always ready with a smile despite her humble position. Her hands are perpetually damp from washing dishes and scrubbing pots, but she approaches her work with enthusiasm and dreams of someday learning to cook like Bertha. She has a keen ear for castle gossip and often knows about events before they officially happen.
