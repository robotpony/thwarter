# Lysa the Shrine Keeper

Lysa is a mysterious figure who tends the ancient shrine with reverent care. She appears to be middle-aged but her eyes hold depths that suggest much greater experience. Her movements are graceful and purposeful, and she speaks in whispers that somehow carry clearly through the forest air. Woodland creatures are drawn to her presence, and she seems to understand their needs and communications.
