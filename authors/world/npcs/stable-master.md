# Thomas the Stable Master

Thomas has an almost supernatural connection with horses and has never met a mount he couldn't gentle. His clothes perpetually smell of hay and horse sweat, and his weathered hands are gentle but firm. He speaks more easily to animals than to people, but those who earn his trust find him to be a loyal friend. The horses respond to his voice like music, and even the most spirited warhorses calm at his approach.
