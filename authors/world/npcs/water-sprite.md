# Ripple the Water Sprite

Ripple is a playful water spirit who inhabits the forest stream and waterfall. She appears as a shimmer in the water or as dancing light on the surface, rarely taking solid form. Her laughter sounds like bubbling water, and she delights in harmless pranks on visitors to her domain. Though mischievous, she is fundamentally benevolent and will sometimes help those who show proper respect for her waters.
