# Master Aldric the Weapons Master

Master Aldric is a grizzled veteran who has served the castle for over thirty years. His weathered hands bear countless scars from forging and testing weapons, and his keen eyes can spot a flaw in steel from across the room. Though his hair has gone gray and his back has bent slightly from years of labor, his knowledge of weapons and armor is unmatched in the kingdom.
