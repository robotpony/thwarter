# Ancient Tomes

A collection of leather-bound books containing centuries of accumulated knowledge. The volumes cover subjects ranging from history and philosophy to magic and natural sciences. Their pages are yellowed with age, and the ink has faded to a warm brown, but the knowledge within remains as valuable as ever.
