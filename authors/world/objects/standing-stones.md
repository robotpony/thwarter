# Standing Stones

Ancient megalithic stones arranged in a perfect circle around the forest clearing. Each stone is taller than a person and covered with mysterious symbols that seem to shift and change when viewed from different angles. The stones emanate a subtle magical energy that makes the air shimmer slightly around them.
